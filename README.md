# JPS vs Dijkstra
A repository for the course Aineopintojen harjoitustyÃ¶: Algoritmit ja tekoÃ¤ly (period 4) LaboratoriotyÃ¶skentely<br /><br />

Currently the tool is still under production ðŸ› . The goal is to have a tool that can show to the user the functioning of the algorithms and that can compare the two algorithms in terms of time complexity. For details, make sure to look into the [specification document](https://github.com/jakubgrad/Aineopintojen-harjoitusty-Algoritmit-ja-teko-ly-/blob/main/documentation/specification%20document.md) ðŸ“Ž<br /><br />
To understand `JPS` better I recommend reading [this article](https://zerowidth.com/2013/a-visual-explanation-of-jump-point-search/) and [this blogpost](https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/artificial-intelligence/jump-point-search-fast-a-pathfinding-for-uniform-cost-grids-r4220/)
To test out the app simply download the repository, then <br />
```
cd Aineopintojen-harjoitusty-Algoritmit-ja-teko-ly-/ 
poetry shell 
```
After doing that, you have plenty of choices for testing out the application. Currently there is both a graphical interface tool and a command line tool.
To use the graphical tool, run in the topmost directory of the project:
```
poetry run invoke start
```
A window like the one below should open <br/>![image](https://github.com/jakubgrad/Aineopintojen-harjoitusty-Algoritmit-ja-teko-ly-/assets/113715885/cd760ad4-5d2c-400e-b259-cc8831fb1d97)
Now that the tool is open you can test it. If you run the command in the topmost directory, when you click on "Choose map" a few options should appear. I would recommend first testing JPS. For that, the best choice would be to pick `wall.map`, start coordinates 0,0 and goal coordinates 4,7. After you clikc on `Run JPS` you should see a short visualization of the algorithm.
If you want to see Dijkstra, there's unfortunately no visualization for that yet, and running the algorithm on any chosen map will only produce the length of the shortest path found using Dijkstra algorithm. You can see it if you choose e.g. the `arena.map`, start coordinates 4,3 and goal coordinates 5,11.
<br/>
The command line too also exists because I started working on the algorithms using command line simulations. To test them out, you can e.g. run:
```
poetry run invoke jps
```
which is a shortcut for `python3 cli.py --jps --visual --map wall.map 0 0 4 7` and has the advantage over the graphical interface that it uses colors and logs comments on what's happenning. It also produces the final path as a series of coordinates at the end unlike the graphical interface. <br />
It's also possible to test dijkstra in command line with:
```
poetry run invoke dijktra
```
Although the output being just the length of the path isn't too exciting. To learn more about the command line type:
```
python3 src/cli.py --help
```
The command line tool also allows you to pass start and goal coordinates as arguments.<br/>
Other useful commands are:
```
poetry run invoke test
```
To run `pytest` on the code and 

```
poetry run invoke coverage-report
```
To create and open in a browser the branch coverage. <br/>
If you are experiencing any issues with the command line or graphical tool, you might want to run:
```
poetry shell
poetry install
```
If there are import problems with python, the following might help:
```
export PYTHONPATH=/home/x/Documents/Algorithms\ and\ AI/Aineopintojen-harjoitusty-Algoritmit-ja-teko-ly-/src/
export PYTHONPATH=/home/x/Documents/Algorithms\ and\ AI/Aineopintojen-harjoitusty-Algoritmit-ja-teko-ly-/src/services
```
Currently the code isn't the nicest and needs a lot of refactoring, but feel free to take a look at JPS code! It was very challenging to write it from ground-up.
