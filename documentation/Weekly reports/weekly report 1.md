put it in the folder weekly reports
The report is about half a page to two pages long. The report is always returned in connection with the weekly return, placed in the same folder with the other documentation and named clearly, e.g. Weekly report 1 .
Also add to the weekly report how much time you spent on work during the week. The number of hours used does not affect the evaluation.
The report must be prepared using markdown or returned as a pdf.


I chose my programming language to be python, because i have the most familiarity with it. 
Answer the following questions in the text:
What have I been up to this week?
The first week I decided to look at the available topics. Using Markov chains looked appealing at first, but it seems too late to talk to the instructor about it and I had two better ideas. 
I read all the introductory materials linked on Moodle (how to use Poetry, version control, what are good examples of projects). I read through the suggested ideas. I initialized the repository with a skeleton of project management that I’ll use, using an example  of maksukortti to see if testing works. I registered it to Labtool.
I was considering different route finding algorithms. I like algorithms that find routes for buses, for instance. I asked Chatgpt what kind of algorithms can be used to improve public transport, and I read about Raptor. It sounds very interesting, but it’s probably much harder than a regular Djikstra based algorithm. Im stuck between choosing an algorithm to find shortest route in public transport and finding the shortest route for ships. I find these more interesting since i like to create solutions that could be used to solve real life problems. So either  JPS, i.e. Jump Point Search vs Dijkstra or RAPTOR vs something public transport related. I think a ship algorithm would be interesting since the Earth is a globe and the algorithms assume a grid. Maybe there is a way of converting the globe into squares? At least for a single route. Anyway I should probably progress little by little; would be nice to have squares, then hexagons, then hexagons on a globe. 
How has the program progressed?
I haven’t written any specific code. I’ve only practiced using poetry and looked online at implementations of Djikstra and JPS.
What did I learn this week / today?
I learnt how the gitignore file works, what testing coverage looks like, and what kind of problems I would like to solve. I also learnt to write nicer Github `md` files
What was unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly, as you will receive help based on this section if needed.
What I need to do exactly for the first week was a bit unclear, but that’s a common problem for me. Like, how much of the project needs to be prepared. To litigate this, I looked at other model students’ submissions by first week and what they have done.
What do I do next?
I need to lock my choice of an algorithm to implement and make sure I can implement it within the given time 
I spent around 10 hours this week working on the project. <b
