# Weekly Report 1
I chose my programming language to be `Python`, because i have the most familiarity with it. I can review other `Python` coded repositories and to a lesser extent `C` and `bash` code. <br />
1. What have I been up to this week? <br />
   - [x] The first week I decided to look at the available topics. Using Markov chains looked appealing at first, but it seems too late to talk to the instructor about it and I had two better ideas. <br />
   - [x]I read all the introductory materials linked on Moodle (how to use Poetry, version control, what are good examples of projects). I read through the suggested ideas. I initialized the repository with a skeleton of project management that I’ll use, using an example  of maksukortti to see if testing works. I registered it to Labtool.<br />
   - [x] I was considering different route finding algorithms. I like algorithms that find routes for buses, for instance. I asked Chatgpt what kind of algorithms can be used to improve public transport, and I read about Raptor. It sounds very interesting, but it’s probably much harder than a regular **Djikstra** based algorithm. Im stuck between choosing an algorithm to find shortest route in public transport and finding the shortest route for ships. I find these more interesting since i like to create solutions that could be used to solve real life problems. So either  **JPS**, i.e. Jump Point Search vs Dijkstra or RAPTOR vs something public transport related. I think a ship algorithm would be interesting since the Earth is a globe and the algorithms assume a grid. Maybe there is a way of converting the globe into squares? At least for a single route. Anyway I should probably progress little by little; would be nice to have squares, then hexagons, then hexagons on a globe. 
2. How has the program progressed? <br />
   - [ ] I haven’t written any specific code. I’ve only practiced using poetry and looked online at implementations of **Djikstra** and **JPS**.<br />
3. What did I learn this week / today? <br />
   - [x] I learnt how the gitignore file works, what testing coverage looks like, and what kind of problems I would like to solve. I also learnt to write nicer Github `md` files <br />
   - [x] 4. What was unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly, as you will receive help based on this section if needed.  <br />
   - [x] What I need to do exactly for the first week was a bit unclear, but that’s a common problem for me. Like, how much of the project needs to be prepared. To litigate this, I looked at other model students’ submissions by first week and what they have done for their projects. <br />
4. What do I do next? <br />
   - [x] I need to read the feedback from a TA or the teacher on my ideas. I need to decide if I'll want to enable testing the algorithms for hexagonal tiles. I need to start implementing the algorithms within the given time <br /><br />

**Other considerations:** <br />
I spent around **13** hours this week working on the project. <br />
I also want to hear from the **instructor** in the **weekly feedback** if my project will be better graded or if it's worth taking the risk and implementing an algorithm that could find shortest routes on a hexagonal version of the globe (as in my [specification document](https://github.com/jakubgrad/Aineopintojen-harjoitusty-Algoritmit-ja-teko-ly-/blob/main/documentation/specification%20document.md), because that strays away quite far from the initial topic. Perhaps it would've been better in the first place to focus on finding the shortest route on a hexagonal earth. *What are your opinions, course instructor?*
