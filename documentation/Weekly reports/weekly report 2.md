# Weekly Report 2 
1. What have I been up to this week? <br />
   - [x] I have read the paper about JPS. I looked into slides of Datastructures and Algorithms and also at my old implementation of **Dijkstra** in `Python`. Although I have written Dijkstra in many forms before, never did I specifically create a path finding algorithm for a bitmaps with uniform difficulty and obstacles. I decided to write it based on the slides and my previous implementation, and also allow selecting a concrete map for testing the algorithms. I separated the logic of command line use of the tool and the actual algorithm. I wrote tests for Dijkstra.<br />
2. How has the program progressed? <br />
   - [x] I'm happy that implementing **Djikstra** went so smoothfully, and that controlling the tool from the command line is quite convenient. I faced issues with **JPS** since it's still pretty foreign to me and the algorithm in the paper is pretty high level.<br />
3. What did I learn this week / today? <br />
   - [x] I learned to use `coverage` to keep track of whether my algorithm works well. I learnt to write my own tests with `unittest`. I learned what maps look like in practice and how to convert them into graphs needed by Dijkstra <br />
4. What was unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly, as you will receive help based on this section if needed.  <br />
   - [x] I wasn't sure how much of my solution should be purely original. I reworked my earlier **Dijkstra** algorithm and worked with pseudocode from the lecture slides, but I might as well have just adopted the [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/) solution, which I didn't do after all. I suppose the **JPS** also causes problems for me because I need to somehow implement the *pruning* rules on my own. <br />
4. What do I do next? <br />
   - [x] I need to include better comments in my code. I need to get coverage up to 100% if I haven't done it yet. I need to work on **JPS** and the documentation. I need to create a nice visualization of the progress of both algorithms, which I plan to do in the command line. <br /><br />

**Other considerations:** <br />
I spent around **8** hours this week working on the project. <br />
