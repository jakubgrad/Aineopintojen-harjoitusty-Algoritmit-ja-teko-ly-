# Weekly Report 6 
1. What have I been up to this week? <br />
   - [x] I read through checklists about the code. I read through the reviews of my code and made sure everything would work for the demo. I tried to limit the time complexity of Dijkstra, because during presentation I thought I could limit the worst case time complexity if I ended the search when the distance of currently expanded nodes is higher than the cartesian distance between start and goal nodes. This was pretty naive because obviously the path can e.g. be spiral or at the very least not straight, which means that finding the smallest maximum distance is difficult. And in any case, the program initializes arrays the size of the map, so the best time complexity cannot be smaller than the size of the map.
   - I linted some of the code, I didn't manage to lint everything
   - I deleted all debugging printouts and comments
2. How has the program progressed? <br />
   - The program (the UI to be exact) now shows error messages to the user e.g. when the map wasn't selected or the coordinates are out of bounds
3. What did I learn this week / today? <br />
   - I should lint code more regularly
4. What was unclear or caused difficulties? Answer this section honestly, as you will receive help based on this section if needed.  <br />
   - I didn't manage my time well and did less than I wanted to do 
5. What do I do next? <br />
   - It's the final review so not much I could do apart from linting more
**Other considerations:** <br />
I spent around **5** hours this week working on the project including today and before demo day<br />
